         <h1>Stats that Matter</h1>
         <p>In our analysis of statistics from the 2022 NFL Season, we identified a number of statistics that we deemed more indicative of success for a team throughout the year. One of the statistics that we 
            identified as more indicative of success is a team's conversion rate in the redzone. When teams score touchdowns in the redzone, they score 7 points instead of 3, and that teams are more successful
            at that have more success. Below we have compared the redzone efficiency (total touchdowns by redzone opportunities), of the four best teams and the four worst teams. As you will see, there is a 
            huge discrepency. Another important statistics was passing yards. Teams that were effective in throwing the football were more successful in terms of win total.</p>

         <p>The best teams in the NFL (shown in blue on the left of this graph) have a significant amount more in every category (Redzone Conversion Rate, 
            Total Redzone Touchdowns, and Redzone Chances).

            As you will see on the next page, the Bears rushed for more yards than the Chiefs in 10 games last season. However, when looking at passing yards
            on a game-by-game basis, the Bears did not throw for more yards in any game that year, which we believe is a reason they only won 3 games, while the
            Chiefs won 14.
